Hello, I’m Om Mishra , an aspiring developer with experience in Python, HTML, and CSS. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning JavaScript. I’m passionate about writing clean, efficient code and contributing to meaningful open-source projects.

I’m always eager to collaborate with others and learn from the developer community. If you would like to connect, discuss potential collaborations, or share insights, feel free to reach out to me at omdhirajmishra09@gmail.com.
